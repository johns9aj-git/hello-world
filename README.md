# about-me 
Well, I'm a junior in CECH studying for Information Technology (Cybersecurity), although these days it feels like I'm doing less cybersecurity and more coding, which is a good thing. I'm hoping by taking classes like these I can start to incorperate more automation using python or bash (not sure if bash is good for automation but we'll see :)). I already have some experierce with Javascript and Python, but I have no idea how bash works so I'm excited to try it out. 

I'm a simple guy, my hobbies include: Reading (science fiction and action), gaming (I've recently picked up Helldivers 2 and haven't been able to put it down.), and watching movies (I absoulutely love Back To The Future). 

Oh, and my favorite color is red. 

Thanks for reading this :)
